We're the team that measures, carries, installs, solves, smiles, and occasionally reschedules — all in the name of better windows and happier spaces.</p>

                                <p>Hakan is the guy with the tape measure, drill, and a pocket full of granola bars. From measurements to mounting, he handles it all — usually with a smile and sometimes with timelines that are… let's say "ambitious." If something's getting done today, he's probably doing it right now.</p>

                                <p>Matt is the calm behind the chaos. When orders get delayed, suppliers go silent, or the weather has other plans — he's the one crafting polite, blame-free explanations.

                                <p>Masal is the youngest (and arguably the most expressive) member of the team. She brings bold creative direction, such as insisting all blinds should come in pink — or at least sparkle. When not performing surprise quality checks on cookies, she provides strong opinions on what "looks fun" and what "needs more unicorns." She sometimes accompanies us on visits and likes to supervise us :)</p>

                            <p>We were genuinely impressed from the beginning, the very first phone call. Hakan was so kind and patient while walking us through the different options. They showed up right on time, wore shoe covers without even being asked, and left the place spotless after installation. We got our quote less than an hour after our appointment. No chasing, no confusion. You can tell they take pride in doing things the right way. Highly recommended!</p>

The person I spoke to over the phone was warm, helpful, and super knowledgeable. The team that came in was polished, friendly, and so respectful of our home — even our dog liked them! Fast quote, clear communication, clean work. Honestly, it felt like working with a high-end service company but without the premium price tag.</p>

You can immediately tell this business is run by people with a serious corporate background — the level of attention, follow-through, and customer care was next level. From the well-organized quote to the smooth install, everything just clicked. These guys know what exceptional service looks like and they deliver it with a smile. As I always say, take care of the little things, big things take care of themselves.</p>

The quote came the same day, they helped me pick fabrics and they were never pushy. Arrived early on the installation day, wore shoe covers, and even cleaned up after themselves better than most guests! Both guys I interacted with was just so nice. It's rare to find people who are this professional and this human.</p>

                        <h3>How long does this whole thing take?</h3>
                        <p>Custom blinds take 2-3 weeks to make (they're worth the wait, promise). Installation? Usually done in under 3 hours — unless Masal is supervising, then add 30 minutes for unicorn discussions.</p>

                        <p>While Masal would approve, we typically recommend more... timeless options. But hey, it's your space! We'll help you find something that makes both you and your inner 6-year-old happy.</p>
